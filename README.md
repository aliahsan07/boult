Key Value Datastore to be built in Java

## Motivation
The idea is to understand the implementation and internals of a NoSQL database and there is no better way than to implement one yourself. 

## Goals
### Minimum Viable Product 
* Implement a basic data store
* Expose a Web API for crud operations

### Challenges
* Concurrent Controls: Support multiple users operating with the database
* Support Atomic Transactions
* Support of multiple data types
* Persistance and Fault Recovery 
* Make it distributed?
